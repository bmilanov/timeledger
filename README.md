# Overview

Timeledger is a system that tracks time based on tasks and tags.

Check out [Releases] for pre-built binaries.

The project aims to:

    1. Give users visibility on how they spend their time
    2. Have all of the information in a single, human-readable file
    3. Enable adding oneliner task entries consisting of a start time, end time,
       description, and tags
    4. Enable automation, reporting, and analysis. Reports and report templates
       should also be describable in files
    5. Make the format extensible, so that future use cases can be handled

# The timeledger format

The timeledger file is a JSON-formatted list of entries about tasks.
